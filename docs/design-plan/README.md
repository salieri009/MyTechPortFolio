# Design Plan — index

This folder contains the detailed design-plan docs. The originals remain in `design-plan/` at project root. This index links and highlights the most important design-plan files.

Files and quick notes:

- `design-plan/api-design.md` — API endpoints, request/response, authentication considerations.
- `design-plan/architecture-design.md` — System architecture overview, components, and deployment flow.
- `design-plan/backend-design.md` — Backend responsibilities, database, migration notes.
- `design-plan/backend-security-implementation.md` — Security measures for backend.
- `design-plan/frontend-design.md` — Frontend structure, components, state management.
- `design-plan/frontend-security-implementation.md` — Client-side security patterns used.
- `design-plan/portfolio-enhancement-ideas.md` — Future improvements prioritized.
- `design-plan/recruiter-focus-elements.md` — What recruiters should focus on.
- `design-plan/security-improvements.md` — Actionable security improvements.
- `design-plan/CURRENT-IMPLEMENTATION-STATUS.md` — Current status snapshot.

Recommendation: read `architecture-design.md` then `frontend-design.md` + `backend-design.md` to understand system flow.
