Project Documentation

This `docs/` folder is the unified documentation entry-point for the repository. It consolidates and prioritizes the most important concepts and links into a single place so reviewers and hiring managers can quickly find essential information.

How this is organized (high-level):

- `docs/important-concepts.md` — prioritized short-read summary of the project's key technical concepts and decisions (start here).
- `docs/design-plan/` — pointers to the original design-plan content (architecture, backend, frontend, security, enhancements).
- `docs/specs/` — API / DB / frontend specs index.
- `docs/ADR/` — architectural decision records index.
- `docs/test-run/` — test run summaries and quick results.

Quick links:

- Important concepts (summary): ./important-concepts.md
- Design plan index: ./design-plan/README.md
- Specs index: ./specs/README.md
- ADR index: ./ADR/README.md
- Test-run index: ./test-run/README.md

If you want to preserve the original `design-plan/` layout, those files remain in place — these READMEs link and summarize them. Use the `docs/` index for a guided tour.

Next steps:

1. Read `docs/important-concepts.md` for a 5-minute overview.
2. Follow links to deeper material (design-plan/specs/ADR/test-run) as needed.
