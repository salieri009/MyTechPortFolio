# Architectural Decision Records (ADR)

> **Version**: 1.0.0  
> **Last Updated**: 2025-11-17  
> **Status**: Active

## Overview

This directory contains Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) that document major architecture choices, trade-offs, and rationale for the MyTechPortfolio project.

---

## What are ADRs?

ADRs are documents that capture important architectural decisions made along with their context and consequences. They help:

- Understand why certain technologies or patterns were chosen
- Track the evolution of the architecture
- Onboard new team members
- Make informed decisions about future changes

---

## ADR Format

Each ADR follows this structure:

```markdown
# ADR-001: Title

## Status
[Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded]

## Context
[The issue motivating this decision]

## Decision
[The change that we're proposing or have agreed to implement]

## Consequences
[What becomes easier or more difficult to do]
```

---

## Available ADRs

ADR records are maintained in the `design-plan/ADR/` directory. Check that location for:

- Decision records documenting major architecture choices
- Trade-offs and rationale
- Technology selection decisions
- Pattern adoption decisions
