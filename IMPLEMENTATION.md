# Project Implementation Summary

## What's Been Delivered

### 1. Detailed Implementation Specs (4 documents)
- **Frontend Spec**: React + Vite + TS setup, routing, mock/API toggle, demo auth
- **API Spec**: RESTful endpoints, schemas, security, mock parity requirements  
- **Database Spec**: MySQL tables, indexes, constraints, migration strategy
- **UI/UX Spec**: Components, accessibility, responsive rules, design system

### 2. Complete Frontend Application
- **Tech Stack**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite + styled-components + Zustand
- **Pages**: Home (hero + tech stacks), Projects (filter/sort), Project Detail, Academics, About
- **Mock Data**: 3 sample projects, academics, tech stacks with realistic content
- **Features**: Responsive design, dark mode toggle, keyboard navigation, filters

### 3. Production-Ready Architecture
- **Environment Toggles**: `VITE_USE_MOCK` and `VITE_AUTH_MODE` for seamless API/auth switching
- **API Client**: Axios instance with JWT interceptor ready for backend integration
- **State Management**: Zustand stores for filters, theme, UI state
- **Build System**: Optimized Vite config with path aliases, proxy setup

### 4. Engineer-Ready Documentation  
- API endpoints with request/response schemas matching backend requirements
- Database DDL with proper indexes and constraints
- Component library with accessibility and responsive specifications
- Clear integration points for JWT authentication

## Key Implementation Details

### Mock → Real API Switch
```bash
# Development (Mock)
VITE_USE_MOCK=true

# Production (Real Backend)  
VITE_USE_MOCK=false
```
Services automatically route to mock vs real endpoints with no code changes needed.

### Demo → JWT Auth Switch
```bash
# Demo (Bypass)
VITE_AUTH_MODE=demo

# Production (JWT)
VITE_AUTH_MODE=jwt  
```
Auth service handles token storage/retrieval, Axios interceptor adds Bearer tokens.

### Component Architecture
- Styled-components with theme tokens from design plan
- Responsive breakpoints (640/768/1024/1280px)
- Accessibility: focus-visible, ARIA labels, skip links
- Performance: code splitting, lazy loading ready

### Data Flow
- Zustand for UI state (filters, theme, transient)
- Services layer abstracts mock vs real API calls
- Common response envelope: `{ success, data, error }`
- Error handling with user-friendly messages

## Current Status
✅ **Frontend**: Fully functional with mock data  
✅ **Specs**: Implementation-ready for all layers  
⏳ **Backend**: Ready for Spring Boot implementation  
⏳ **Database**: Ready for MySQL setup  
⏳ **Deployment**: AWS architecture planned

## Verification
- Build: ✅ `npm run build` successful
- Dev Server: ✅ `npm run dev` running on localhost:5173
- TypeScript: ✅ All type definitions complete
- Dependencies: ✅ No security issues in audit

The project is now ready for backend development and can be deployed immediately with mock data for demonstration purposes.
